## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Homelun is a cutting-edge real estate application designed to make property searches easy and efficient. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js), TypeScript, React-Query, and Tailwind, Homelun provides a seamless and user-friendly experience for those looking to buy, sell, or rent properties.

With Homelun, users can browse through various properties and apply filters to narrow down their search based on criteria such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, or square footage. The app allows users to request tours of properties and stay in touch with agents for a smooth and hassle-free experience. Homelun's intuitive interface and powerful search capabilities make it the go-to solution for all your real estate needs.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

To get started with Homelun, you'll need to set up the server and client environments. First, navigate to the server folder in your project directory and create an .env file. Use the provided env.example file as a reference to fill in the required information. Once your .env file is set up, you can install the necessary dependencies by running the following commands:

```
npm install
or
yarn install
```

After setting up the server, move on to the client folder and repeat the process. Create an .env file using the env.example as a guide, and then install the required dependencies like previous way.

then run both separately with

```
npm run dev
or
yarn dev
```

## 🚀 Deploying <a name = "deployment"></a>
