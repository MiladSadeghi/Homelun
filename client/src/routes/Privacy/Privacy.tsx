                offers about their services or products that you may be
                interested in. We also may give you the option to receive
                communications from one of our advertising partners, such as
                when we offer a joint promotion with that third-party
                advertiser. If you choose to opt in to receiving communications
                from that third-party advertiser by providing your explicit
                consent, the third-party advertiser will manage your personal

                information under applicable law, we may share such

                third party, we may share information about you with, or
                information may be gathered independently by, the third party.
                In these situations, we will be free to use such information to
                facilitate such features, products and services (or information
                about them) being made available to you and as otherwise
                outlined in this Privacy Notice, and you understand the third
                party may use the information in different ways. Although not
                always the case, you often can tell when information, features,
                products or services are marketed or offered jointly or in
                coordination with a third party because a portion of the
                Services often will be “co-branded” in such cases, will display
                the third party’s logo and/or name (whether or not along with
                our own), will describe or reference the relationship between us
                and the third party or will be set up so that you can contact or
                be linked to the third party or its website to initiate,
                complete or learn more about the transaction. Please be aware
                that each company we do business with (including Professionals)
                has its own policies regarding its use, sharing and protection
                of information about you and that such policies may differ from
                those outlined in this Privacy Notice.
