          Applicable Law; Agreement to Arbitrate
        </h5>
        <p className="font-normal text-base leading-7 mb-6">
          These Terms of Use are governed by the laws of the State of
          California, U.S.A. without regard to conflicts of laws principles. YOU
          HEREBY AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL DISPUTES OR CLAIMS THAT MAY ARISE
          BETWEEN YOU AND MOVE SHALL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH FINAL AND
          BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT, EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY ASSERT
          CLAIMS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT IF YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY. THE FEDERAL
          ARBITRATION ACT SHALL GOVERN THE INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF
          THIS PARAGRAPH. YOU AGREE THAT YOU AND MOVE MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST
          EACH OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS PART OF ANY
          PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH
          YOU AND MOVE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR
          JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE
          PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS
          PROCEEDING. FURTHER, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING
          MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE
          INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO
          PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). THE
          ARBITRATION WILL BE CONDUCTED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION
          ("AAA") UNDER ITS RULES AND PROCEDURES, AS MODIFIED BY THIS PARAGRAPH.
          THE AAA'S RULES ARE AVAILABLE AT WWW.ADR.ORG. A FORM FOR INITIATING
          ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS IS AVAILABLE ON THE AAA'S WEB SITE AT
          https://www.adr.org/. THE ARBITRATION SHALL BE HELD IN THE COUNTY IN
          WHICH YOU RESIDE OR AT ANOTHER MUTUALLY AGREED LOCATION. IF THE VALUE
          OF THE RELIEF SOUGHT IS $10,000 OR LESS, YOU OR MOVE MAY ELECT TO HAVE
          THE ARBITRATION CONDUCTED BY TELEPHONE OR BASED SOLELY ON WRITTEN
          SUBMISSIONS, WHICH ELECTION SHALL BE BINDING ON YOU AND MOVE SUBJECT
          TO THE ARBITRATOR'S DISCRETION TO REQUIRE AN IN-PERSON HEARING, IF THE
          CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT. ATTENDANCE AT AN IN-PERSON HEARING MAY BE MADE
          BY TELEPHONE BY YOU AND/OR MOVE, UNLESS THE ARBITRATOR REQUIRES
          OTHERWISE. THE ARBITRATOR'S AWARD SHALL BE FINAL AND BINDING AND
          JUDGMENT ON THE AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR MAY BE ENTERED IN ANY
          COURT HAVING JURISDICTION THEREOF. PAYMENT OF ALL FILING,
          ADMINISTRATION AND ARBITRATOR FEES WILL BE GOVERNED BY THE AAA'S
          RULES, UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED IN THIS PARAGRAPH. IF A COURT DECIDES
          THAT ANY PART OF THIS PARAGRAPH IS INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE, THE OTHER
          PARTS OF THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL STILL APPLY. ACCESS OR USE OF THE MOVE
          NETWORK IS UNAUTHORIZED IN ANY JURISDICTION THAT DOES NOT GIVE EFFECT
          TO ALL PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING WITHOUT
          LIMITATION THIS PARAGRAPH.

          superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches

          Use shall continue in effect. Unless otherwise specified herein (or in
          any other definitive written agreement between you and Move), the
          Terms of Use constitutes the entire agreement between you and Move
